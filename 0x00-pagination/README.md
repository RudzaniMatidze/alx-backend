# 0x00-pagination

### Definition
A pagination API refers to an API design pattern that allows large sets of data to be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks, which are then delivered in response to multiple requests. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets where sending all the data in a single response would be inefficient or impractical.
